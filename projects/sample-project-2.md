## Project Background

City Bistro needed a cohesive brand identity that reflected its contemporary cuisine and community-focused atmosphere. The old branding was inconsistent and lacked a memorable visual presence.

## Strategy and Execution

- Created mood boards and conducted stakeholder interviews to define brand personality.
- Designed a versatile logo, color palette, and typography system.
- Developed a comprehensive brand guidelines document for consistency across print and digital channels.
- Implemented new signage, menus, and social media templates.

## Impact

The new branding helped City Bistro stand out in a competitive market, attracting a younger demographic and boosting overall engagement.
