## The Challenge

Sweet Treats NC had been a cornerstone of the Durham community for over 15 years, known for their exceptional pastries and personalized service. However, their digital presence didn't reflect their in-store excellence, with an outdated website that wasn't mobile-friendly and lacked online ordering capabilities. When the pandemic hit, they faced a significant drop in foot traffic and urgently needed to adapt.

## Strategic Approach

After a thorough assessment of their business model and customer base, we developed a comprehensive digital transformation strategy with several key components:

### 1. Customer Journey Mapping

We conducted interviews with existing customers and analyzed purchase patterns to create detailed customer personas. This research revealed that many loyal customers would prefer ordering online for pickup to avoid lines, especially for custom cake orders.

### 2. Mobile-First Website Redesign

The new website was designed with a mobile-first approach, emphasizing:

- Fast loading times for improved user experience
- High-quality product photography with zoom capabilities
- Intuitive navigation organized by product category
- Clear calls-to-action throughout the customer journey
- Location-based features to drive in-store visits

### 3. Seamless E-Commerce Integration

We implemented a custom ordering system that addressed the unique challenges of a bakery business:

- Specialized forms for custom cake orders with detailed options
- Clear lead times for different product categories
- Integrated inventory management to prevent overselling limited items
- Flexible pickup time scheduling to manage kitchen workflow

### 4. Local Marketing Automation

To build on their community presence, we developed:

- An email marketing program with personalized offers based on purchase history
- Targeted local SEO improvements focusing on "bakery near me" searches
- A customer loyalty program that bridged online and in-store purchases
- Strategic social media campaigns highlighting seasonal offerings

## Implementation and Results

The implementation was phased over three months to ensure staff training and system testing were thorough. Key outcomes included:

- **215% increase in online sales** within six months of launch
- **430% growth in email subscriber list** through strategic signup incentives
- **Improved efficiency** with 32% reduction in time spent on phone orders
- **Higher average order value** online ($42) compared to in-store ($28)
- **Enhanced customer satisfaction** ratings from 3.7 to 4.8 stars
