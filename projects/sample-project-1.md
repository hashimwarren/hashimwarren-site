## Project Overview

Sweet Treats NC, a beloved local bakery, needed to modernize their online presence to better serve their customers and streamline their ordering process. Their existing website was outdated, difficult to navigate on mobile devices, and lacked integrated online ordering.

## Strategy & Execution

Our strategy focused on several key areas:

1.  **User Experience (UX) Research:** Conducted surveys and user testing to understand customer needs and pain points.
2.  **Responsive Web Design:** Created a visually appealing, mobile-first design that showcased their products effectively.
3.  **E-commerce Integration:** Implemented a user-friendly online ordering system with secure payment processing.
4.  **Content Strategy:** Revised website copy to be more engaging and SEO-friendly, highlighting their unique selling propositions.

## Results

The new website launched successfully, leading to:

*   A **40% increase in online orders** within the first three months.
*   A **60% improvement in mobile usability scores**.
*   Positive feedback from customers on the new design and ease of use.
